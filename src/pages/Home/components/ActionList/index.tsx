          Each NFT can mine Neutron at different rates based off the cost to

          NFT in that collection.

          We have set up a token supply that is in complete control of the users
          and benefits people who help build Neutron in its early stages! We
          have a 10-year mining plan in order to mine all 21,000,000 Neutron
          tokens. Proton token mining is set up a little bit differently. Both
          Tokens can only be mined by staking NFTâ€™s for time.
